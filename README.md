### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I am Jan from Karlsuhe, Germany. I study mechatronics and information technology at KIT (Bachelor still).

I have a part-time job at the KIT language center programming the registration platform for speech courses (anmeldung.spz.kit.edu).
I like to code in the area of web applications with Python as backend using Flask.
Originally, I started working in the spanish department. I love the Latino culture and I am eager to improve my spanish in every occasion.
After one semester I joined the database team adittionally to optimize the daily workflow adding new features to the registration platform.
